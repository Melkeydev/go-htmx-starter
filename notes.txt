Notes:
    - To use Tailwind in dev we can just use the CDN 
    - Everything in HTMX is made with .html files
        - Need to find the best way to structure and render with it
    - In the .html file there is an id with counter and a 'state' value:
        - "{{.CounterValue}} 
        - template.New:
            - Allocates a new HTML template with the given name
        - template.Must:
            - Intended to be used for variable initialization 
        - templaet.Must(template.New("counter").Parse(tmpString)):
            this creates a piece of HTML from tmpString and assigns it to the id of 
            "counter"
        - template.ExecuteTemplate(w, "counter", data):
            data will contain the variable in the {{.CounterValue}} that is referenced
            in the .html
